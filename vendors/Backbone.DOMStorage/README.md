# Backbone localStorage and sessionStorage Adapter v1.0

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/mikeedwards/Backbone.DOMStorage.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/mikeedwards/Backbone.DOMStorage)

Quite simply a localStorage and sessionStorage adapter for Backbone. It's a drop-in replacement for Backbone.Sync() to handle saving to a localStorage or sessionStorage databases.

This is a *rough* fork of jeromegn's excellent Backbone.localStorage module.

## Usage

Include Backbone.domStorage after having included Backbone.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="backbone.domStorage.js"></script>
```

Create your collections like so:

```javascript
window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  
  localStorage: new Backbone.LocalStorage("SomeLocalCollection"), // Unique name within your app.
  
  // ... everything else is normal.
  
});
```

*or*

```javascript
window.SomeCollection = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  
  sessionStorage: new Backbone.SessionStorage("SomeSessionCollection"), // Unique name within your app.
  
  // ... everything else is normal.
  
});
```

Feel free to use Backbone as you usually would, this is a drop-in replacement.

## Contributing

You'll need node and to `npm install` before being able to run the minification script.

1. Fork;
2. Write code;
3. Write tests (or vice et versa);
4. `make test`;
5. `make minified`;
6. Create a pull request.

Have fun!
